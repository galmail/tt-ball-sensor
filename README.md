# TT Ball Sensor

This project is just an experiment which involves using different sensors on the phone
in order to detect when a table tennis ball bounces on the table.

In this first release, it is only available for iOS devices.

It is written in Swift and it is using the CoreMotion library and the TempiFFT library.
